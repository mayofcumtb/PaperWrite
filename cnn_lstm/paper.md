# Crowd Analysis in Semi-supervised Deep Neural Network: Connect CNN with LSTM in Crowd Analysis.

## Abstract:

## Introduction:

<font color=blue>Motivation(300)</font>:  
Recently , deep neural networks(DNN) set off a storm in Artificial Intelligence(AI). Because of the excellent feature extraction and analysis capabilities of DNN, many research fields have changed their research technique, such as image classification, scene understanding, audio analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and so on. (CNN from beginning give the surprised of computer vision ,some person give some method . And duet to )Inspired of these method, [] make deep learning method going deep, they proposed RCNN methods broad Convolutional Neural Networks into object detection field.
However, due to the complexity of video data which consists with tremendous image data and intricate temporal sequence, Deep learning method hardly went deep into video analysis.
